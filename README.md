## Questions:

So as not to be a fool on the one night it is needed.\

2. Who’s Scruffy?
3. Should I read the Tao Te Ching, or the Art of War?
4. I have memories of having a talking shed. What was its name?\
John\

5. Could anyone have seen the bitcoin boom coming?
6. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been nervous when I’m near a merry-go-round if I have a bottle of water with me. Why is that?\
